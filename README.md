## Project Overview

In this project, I will clone AIRBNB, to offer a replication of the platform. I will be emphasizing user security, authentication, property management, booking, payment proessing, rating, and data storagge/retrieval. 

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework:** Django (Python) – I will be using DJANGO to build the the RESTful API.
- **API Toolkit:** Django REST Framework – These tools will be used to create and manage the RESTful APIs.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL – I will be using PostgreSQL as the database to store the data.
- **API Query Language:** GraphQL – I will also be using GraphQL, in querying data.
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Celery – I will use Celery to handle other background activities, for example, notifications or payment processing.
- **Caching/Session Management:** Redis – I will use Redis in caching data and managing user sessions.
- **Containerization:** Docker – Docker will be used to ensure the consistent development and deployment environments.
- **Automation:** CI/CD Pipelines – Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
