## Project Overview

In this project, I will clone AIRBNB, to offer a replication of the platform. I will be emphasizing user security, authentication, property management, booking, payment proessing, rating, and data storagge/retrieval. 

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework:** Django (Python) – I will be using DJANGO to build the the RESTful API.
- **API Toolkit:** Django REST Framework – These tools will be used to create and manage the RESTful APIs.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL – I will be using PostgreSQL as the database to store the data.
- **API Query Language:** GraphQL – I will also be using GraphQL, in querying data.
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Celery – I will use Celery to handle other background activities, for example, notifications or payment processing.
- **Caching/Session Management:** Redis – I will use Redis in caching data and managing user sessions.
- **Containerization:** Docker – Docker will be used to ensure the consistent development and deployment environments.
- **Automation:** CI/CD Pipelines – Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Project Goals

1. **User Management:**  
   Allow users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely.

2. **Property Management:**  
   Users can list their properties, as well as update or view property information.

3. **Booking System:**  
   Enable users to reserve or book listed properties easily.

4. **Payment Processing:**  
   Provide a secure system for handling payments and recording transaction details.

5. **Review System:**  
   Allow users to rate and review properties after their stay.

6. **Data Optimization:**  
   Ensure fast and efficient storage and retrieval of data in the database.

## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer:**  
  The backe end developer will implement API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.

- **Database Administrator:**  
  The database administrator will manage database design, perform indexing, and data oprimizations.

- **DevOps Engineer:**  
  The DevOps Engineer will deploy, monitor, and scale the backe end side.

- **QA Engineer:**  
  The QA Engineer will be responsible of testing the backe end to ensure they align with quality standards.

  ## Database Design

The project uses a relational database to manage and store all data. Below are the key entities and their main fields:

### Entities and Fields

#### 1. User
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Full name of the user
- `email`: Email address
- `password`: Hashed password
- `role`: Host or Guest

#### 2. Property
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Owner (host) reference
- `title`: Property name
- `location`: Address or city
- `price`: Nightly price

#### 3. Booking
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Guest reference
- `property_id`: Booked property reference
- `start_date`: Check-in date
- `end_date`: Check-out date

#### 4. Review
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Reviewer reference
- `property_id`: Reviewed property reference
- `rating`: Score (e.g., 1-5)
- `comment`: Review text

#### 5. Payment
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `booking_id`: Associated booking
- `amount`: Payment amount
- `status`: Paid, pending, etc.
- `timestamp`: Date and time of payment

### Entity Relationships

- A **User** can own multiple **Properties** (if they are a host).
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Booking** is made by a **User** (guest) for a **Property**.
- A **Booking** can have one **Payment**.
- A **User** can leave multiple **Reviews** for different **Properties**.
- A **Property** can have multiple **Reviews**.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and securely manage their profiles. This feature ensures that only authenticated users can access certain functionalities and provides options for updating personal information.

### Property Management
Enables hosts to list new properties, edit details, and manage availability. This feature makes it easy for property owners to offer accommodations and keep their listings accurate and up-to-date.

### Booking System
Lets guests search for properties, view availability, and book accommodations for specific dates. It manages reservation conflicts and ensures a smooth transaction between guests and hosts.

### Payment Processing
Handles secure payments for bookings, integrating with payment gateways and tracking transaction status. This feature ensures that both hosts and guests have confidence in the safety and reliability of financial transactions.

### Review System
Allows users to leave ratings and reviews for properties they have stayed in. This helps build trust in the platform by sharing real experiences and feedback, guiding future guests in their decisions.

### Data Optimization
Implements techniques to store and retrieve data efficiently, ensuring fast response times and scalability. This feature is crucial for maintaining high performance as the user base and property listings grow.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protecting user data, ensuring safe transactions, and maintaining trust in the platform. The following security measures will be implemented in this project:

- **Authentication:**  
  All users must verify their identity before accessing protected endpoints. This prevents unauthorized access, ensuring that only legitimate users can manage accounts, bookings, and properties.

- **Authorization:**  
  The system ensures users can only access and modify resources they own or are permitted to use. For example, only property owners can update their listings, and only guests who made a booking can leave a review. This prevents data leaks and abuse.

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Limits the number of requests a user or client can make in a given time period. This helps prevent abuse, denial-of-service attacks, and protects backend resources from being overwhelmed.

- **Data Encryption:**  
  Sensitive data (such as passwords and payment details) will be encrypted both in transit and at rest. This protects user credentials and financial information from interception or theft.

- **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  
  All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This ensures the application processes only safe and expected inputs.

Security is crucial for protecting user personal information, securing payments, maintaining data integrity, and preserving the platform’s reputation. Implementing these measures helps ensure a trustworthy and reliable service for all users.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. This ensures that new features, bug fixes, and updates are delivered quickly and reliably, with minimal manual intervention. By running automated tests and checks on every code change, CI/CD pipelines help maintain code quality, prevent regressions, and streamline the development workflow.

For this project, tools such as **GitHub Actions** can be used to automate testing, building, and deployment processes. **Docker** may be incorporated to provide consistent environments across development and production. Implementing a CI/CD pipeline ensures that the project remains stable and up-to-date as it evolves.
